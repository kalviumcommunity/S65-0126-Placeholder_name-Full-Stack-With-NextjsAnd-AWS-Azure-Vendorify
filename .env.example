# .env.example - Template for required environment variables
# Commit this file to the repository. Do NOT put real secrets here.

# DATABASE_URL
# - Purpose: Database connection string used by server-side code (ORM, DB clients).
# - Visibility: SERVER-SIDE ONLY. Never expose this in client bundles.
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://<username>:<password>@<host>:5432/<db_name>?schema=public"

# NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL
# - Purpose: Base URL used by browser-side code to call your API endpoints.
# - Visibility: CLIENT-SIDE (frontend). Must be prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` so Next.js exposes it to the browser.
# - Why the prefix: Next.js only includes variables that start with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` in client bundles. Without it, the variable stays server-only and is not available in browser code.
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL="http://localhost:3000/api"

# Usage: copy this file to `.env.local` and fill in real values for local development.# Public (exposed to the browser)
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ENV=development
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=https://api.example.com

# Server-only (set via CI/CD secret stores; never commit real values)
SERVER_API_KEY=__REPLACE_ME__
