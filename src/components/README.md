Directory for reusable UI components.

Guidelines:
- Each component may live in its own folder: `ComponentName/` with `index.tsx`, `styles.module.css`, and `README.md`.
- Keep components small and focused (single responsibility).
- Use Storybook or dedicated examples for complex components in later sprints.

Example:
```
src/components/Button/index.tsx
src/components/Button/Button.module.css
```
